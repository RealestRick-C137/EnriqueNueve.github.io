						<h2>Learning to play Go</h2>
						<p> August 2020</p>
					</header>

					<br></br>
					<h3> Intro</h3>
					<p> &emsp; With respect to the date I am writing this, I have been in
						quarantine for around six months (give or take) due to Covid-19. My
						interaction with society have been limited, leaving me with a surplus
						of time to learn an array of things (and time to write unnecessary blog posts).
						In particular, in the last two months, I have learned to play the game of Go. </a>
						<br> </br>
						&emsp; According to myself, Go is a two-player non-corporative strategy game in which the objective
						of each player is to control the most territory as possible. Being that both players are trying to control as
						much territory as possible on the same finite-dimensional board, the two players must strategize their captures
						of territory in order to limit the possible collection of territory of the other player.
						Yes, fascinating, but how does one play the game?
					</p>

					<h3>Rules of Go</h3>
					<p> &emsp; As mentioned Go is a two player game. Go is played on a board that has a grid pattern, traditionaally of size 19x19 [1].
						Each player is given (or chooses) a set of stones. Stones are the playing pieces of the game. There are black stones (which number to 181)
						and there are white stones (which numbere to 180) [1]. Whoever has the black stones goes first.
						<br> </br>
						&emsp; During one's turn, such as the first turn performed by black, the player is allowed to place a stone
						of their color on an empty intersection on the board (which includes edges and corners). Upon placing one's stone on the board, the player's
						turn is complete, in which the game then proceeds to the next player's turn. Beyond placing a stone during one's turn, a player
						may choose to pass, which is the act of not placing a stone during one's turn. If a player passes, their turn is over, and it is the
						other players turn once again. If two passes occur consecutively, meaning player one passes and then player two passes,
						the game is over, and points are counted (point-counting will be discussed momentarily). However, arguably one of the most
						critical aspects of Go has yet to be discussed, capturing your opponent's stones.
						<br> </br>
						&emsp; To capture an opponent's stone or stones, you must enclose all of your opponent's said stones' liberties. What is a liberty, though? A liberty is the relative horizontal and verticle paths directly connected to a stone or
						a set of stones that are connected in a non-diagonal manner. Makes sense, right? If not, don't worry, examples and images
						shall be presented in the following paragraph.
