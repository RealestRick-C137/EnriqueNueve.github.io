						<h2>Learning to play Go</h2>

					</header>

					<br></br>
					<h3> Intro</h3>
					<p> &emsp;  With respect to the date I am writing this, I have been in quarantine
						for around six months (give or take) due to Covid-19. My interaction with society
						has been limited, leaving me with a surplus of time to learn an array of things
						(and time to write unnecessary blog posts). In particular, in the last two months,
						I have learned to play the game of Go. </a>
						<br> </br>
						&emsp;  According to myself, Go is a two-player non-corporative strategy game in
						which the objective of each player is to control the most territory as possible.
						Since both players are trying to control as much territory as possible on the same
						finite-dimensional board, the two players must strategize their captures of territory
						to limit the possible collection of territory of the other player. Yes, fascinating, but how does one play the game?
					</p>

					<h3>Rules of Go</h3>
					<p> &emsp;  As mentioned Go is a two-player game. Go is played on a board that has a grid pattern,
						traditionally of size 19x19 [1]. Each player is given (or chooses) a set of stones. Stones are the
						playing pieces of the game. There are black stones (which number to 181), and there are white stones
						(which numbers to 180) [2]. Whoever has the black stones go first.
						<br> </br>
						&emsp;  During one's turn, such as the first turn performed by black, the player is allowed to place a
						stone of their color on an empty intersection on the board (which includes edges and corners).
						Upon placing one's stone on the board, the player's turn is complete, in which the game then proceeds
						to the next player's turn. Beyond placing a stone during one's turn, a player may choose to pass,
						which is the act of not placing a stone during one's turn. If a player passes, their turn is over,
						and it is the other player's turn once again. If two passes occur consecutively, meaning player
						one passes and then player two passes, the game is over, and points are counted (point-counting
						will be discussed momentarily). However, arguably one of the most critical aspects of Go has yet
						to be discussed, capturing your opponent's stones.
						<br> </br>
						&emsp; To capture an opponent's stone or stones, you must enclose all of your opponent's said stones' liberties. What is a liberty, though? A liberty is the relative horizontal and verticle paths directly connected to a stone or
						a set of stones that are connected in a non-diagonal manner. Makes sense, right? If not, don't worry, examples and images
						shall be presented in the following paragraph.
						<br> </br>
						&emsp;For example, a stone placed in an interior intersection has four liberties, being that there is an adjacent intersection above,
						below, to the right, and to the left (given no stones are placed next to it). Another case is when a stone is placed
						on the edge of the board. A stone on the board's edge has open positions to the left, right, and facing inward to the board;
						thus, the stone has three liberties. A third case to consider is when a stone is placed on the corner intersection of the board.
						A stone placed in a corner has two liberties being that there are two intersections located non-diagonally
						with respect to the corner. Examples of the three mentioned cases are provided in the images below. As mentioned, to capture an opponent's
						stone, you must enclose all of the liberties.
						<br> </br>

						<figcaption> Fig 1: Left ~ Four Liberties, Center ~ Three Liberties, Right ~ Two Liberties </figcaption>
					</figure>
					<br> </br>
					&emsp; To explain this conept of capturing an oponents stone, I will refer to the photos directly below as refrence.
					<figure>
						<img src="images/go_blog_images/ko_example.jpg" class="image fit" />
						<figcaption> Fig 2: Left ~ Atari, Center ~ Capture, Right ~ Ko </figcaption>
					</figure>
					In the photo on the left, the white stone has one liberty left. The reason that the white stone has only one liberty is because
					the stone only has one vertical or horizontal intersection adjacent to it not covered by an opponent's black stone. This situation
					where a stone has only one liberty left is called 'atari.' Suppose it is currently the black player's turn, and they place a stone
					on the last open liberty with respect to the white stone. This completes a capture and the white stone is removed from the board (refer to
					the center image). Now it is the white player's turn. It is necessary to know that the white player can not play immediately after in the same position to attempt to
					reclaim the territory; this is referred to as 'ko.' However, in this particular case, the white player may not place a stone even after a cycle of turns
					in the same spot since the move would cause suicide, and the stone would be recaptured. Suicidal moves are banned in Go. To prevent captures of one's stones,
					it is strategic to form groups out of them.
					<br> </br>
					&emsp; A group is formed when a player connects two or more of their own stones adjacently in a verticle or horizontal fashion.
					For example, three stones placed vertically adjacent to one another forms a group (refer to the image below on the left). By forming
					a group, the stones act as a single structure, and their liberties are in a manner "combined." In reference to the previously mentioned
					example of three stones (as shown in the image below on the left), the group has a total of eight liberties. However, recall for stones
					to be connected in order to form a group, the stones must be touching with respect to a verticle or horizontal relationship. The image provided
					below to the right is an example of two stones that do not form a group since they are only touching in a diagonal relationship.
					<br> </br>

					</figure>
					<br> </br>
					&emsp; Now that we have covered the general interactions that can occur during the game, it is time to address how the game is scored.
					As mentioned, suppose two consecutive passes occur, and the game has come to an end. The scoring formula is as such: a player's score is
					equal to the number of controlled territories minus the number of their stones taken captive [1]. To understand the given formula, it is
					necessary to understand what is a captured territory. Placing a stone on the board is not in itself a captured territory. A captured territory
					is a space in which a single color's stone blocks all of its surrounding area. Examples of captures are provided in the images below.
					<br> </br>

						<figcaption> Fig 4: White points ~ blue X's and Black points ~ red X's </figcaption>
					</figure>
					<br> </br>
					&emsp; In "Fig 4," a sample game on a smaller than the traditional sized board is shown. The blue X's are the captured territories of white totaling
					to six while the red X's are the black points totaling to seventeen (recall to subtract taken prisoners to your score). Thus, the black player
					would have won this game. Depending on the skill of your opponent, white may get a handicap to their score called 'komi' (usually six and a half to seven points)
					due to going second. So, from reading this post, do you know all of the rules of Go now? Unfournatly, no. Go has many nuances due to the numerous situations that may arise during the game.
					For myself, I watched many videos and read
					blogs to gather a fundamental understanding of the rules of Go.
					However, I believe the fastest way to learn Go is by playing it, particularly playing Go a lot. To do so, I decided to play Go online.
					</p>


					<h3>5x5 Go</h3>
					<p>
						&emsp; As mentioned, I started to play Go online in order to develop my understanding of the game. Particularly,
						I started to play 5x5 Go (Go that uses a 5x5 board). I had read that beginners should learn to play
						on a smaller board. This led me to play against this nightmare machine of a bot at <a href="https://www.cosumi.net/en/">https://www.cosumi.net/en/</a>.
						In essence, this machine became my overlord haunting my dreams. Every game I would play against it, I would lose. No matter how close I got to win,
						it would turn the game and win. This machine was likely running some Dynamic Programming algorithm, which almost guaranteed its victory.
						I thought to change the bot's difficulty, but oh wait, there was no way to change the difficulty.
						However, my pride had gotten the better of me, and I was not ready to back against down.
					</p>


					<h3>One possible way to win 5x5 Go </h3>
					<p> &emsp; With the board being 5x5, the number of permutations of game outcomes
						were beyond cognitive interpretation, so I opted for a probabilistic approach to
						playing the game. In the online game, the robot was always assigned white; thus, I played black
						and went first. My strategy was to play the first move in the center, thus giving me the most options of dividing the board.
						I played some seventy to eighty games with trying to play my first stone in the center yet, no luck at all.
						<br></br>
						&emsp; The bot would then play wide and work around the board, blocking me internally and then capturing my pieces.
						I also thought to play in the center and then try to divide the board almost in half with more area in my favor. However, being
						that I was playing against a computer, it perfectly calculated how many stones to place and when to pass so that
						the last move was in its favor letting it win by a point or two. At this point, I questioned the possibility
						of whether or not it was possible to beat this bot. All of these losses made me question if playing in the center
						was an optimal move to begin the game.
						<br></br>
						&emsp; At this point, I had lost over a hundred games, and about seven weeks had passed. My motivation
						to continue playing was lacking yet, I was still upset with the idea of submitting to a
						bot. From the several previous games, I noticed I would lose by only one or two points, so I hypothesized
						that the game would be a close call. I mentally could not establish a strategy due
						to the sheer number of possible moves. To reduce the potential number of plays
						that could occur, I sought to develop a strategy that leveraged eyes.
						<br></br>
						&emsp; Eyes are a particular style of groups that are impossible to capture. Eyes are possible
						due to the structure of the game in which a player may only place one stone per turn. For example,
						take a look at the images below (Fig 5).
					<br></br>
					<figure>
						<img src="images/go_blog_images/eyes_a.jpg" class="image fit" />
						<figcaption> Fig 5: Example of Eyes </figcaption>
					</figure>
					<br></br>
					&emsp; The white player would need first to surround the group and then place stones at the same time
					inside of the empty spaces in the eyes. Yet, if the white player places a stone inside the eyes,
					they would commit suicide, which isn't allowed. Therefore, to capture the eyes, both spots
					would have to be filled simultaneously, which is not possible, making the group uncapturable.

					<br></br>
					&emsp; As mentioned, I leveraged eyes to create a field advantage to limit the number of outcomes
					in order to formulate a strategy. The following images below show how I established multiple eyes
					in order to win the game.
					<br></br>

					</figure>
					<br></br>
					</p>



					<h3>Conclusion</h3>
					<p>
						&emsp; Through the use of eyes, I was able to beat the bot by two points. Looking back
					 at the plays I did, this strategy could be used to win by four points if modified. Overall, I was
					 able to learn the fundamentals of Go and establish human dominance over this Dynamic Programming
					 devil. If you desire to learn how to play Go, I recommend playing against this same bot
					 (<a href="https://www.cosumi.net/en/">https://www.cosumi.net/en/</a>). As frustrating as it was,
					 I was able to develop an understanding of the rules and basic strategies of Go.
