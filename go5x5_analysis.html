						<h2>Learning to play Go</h2>
						<p> August 2020</p>
					</header>

					<img src="images/go_banner.jpg" class="image fit" />


					<br></br>
					<h3> Intro</h3>
					<p> &emsp; With respect to the date I am writing this, I have been in
						quarantine for around six months (give or take) due to Covid-19. My
						interaction with society have been limited, leaving me with a surplus
						of time to learn an array of things (and time to write unnecessary blog posts).
						In particular, in the last two months, I have learned to play the game of Go. </a>
						<br> </br>
						&emsp; According to myself, Go is a two-player non-corporative strategy game in which the objective
						of each player is to control the most territory as possible. Being that both players are trying to control as
						much territory as possible on the same finite-dimensional board, the two players must strategize their captures
						of territory in order to limit the possible collection of territory of the other player.
						Yes, fascinating, but how does one play the game?
					</p>

					<h3>Rules of Go</h3>
					<p> &emsp; As mentioned Go is a two player game. Go is played on a board that has a grid pattern, traditionally of size 19x19 [1].
						Each player is given (or chooses) a set of stones. Stones are the playing pieces of the game. There are black stones (which number to 181)
						and there are white stones (which numbere to 180) [2]. Whoever has the black stones goes first.
						<br> </br>
						&emsp; During one's turn, such as the first turn performed by black, the player is allowed to place a stone
						of their color on an empty intersection on the board (which includes edges and corners). Upon placing one's stone on the board, the player's
						turn is complete, in which the game then proceeds to the next player's turn. Beyond placing a stone during one's turn, a player
						may choose to pass, which is the act of not placing a stone during one's turn. If a player passes, their turn is over, and it is the
						other players turn once again. If two passes occur consecutively, meaning player one passes and then player two passes,
						the game is over, and points are counted (point-counting will be discussed momentarily). However, arguably one of the most
						critical aspects of Go has yet to be discussed, capturing your opponent's stones.
						<br> </br>
						&emsp; To capture an opponent's stone or stones, you must enclose all of your opponent's said stones' liberties. What is a liberty, though? A liberty is the relative horizontal and verticle paths directly connected to a stone or
						a set of stones that are connected in a non-diagonal manner. Makes sense, right? If not, don't worry, examples and images
						shall be presented in the following paragraph.
						<br> </br>
						&emsp;For example, a stone placed in an interior intersection has four liberties, being that there is an adjacent intersection above,
						below, to the right, and to the left (given no existing stones are placed next to it). Another case is when a stone is placed
						on the edge of the board. A stone on the board's edge has open positions to the left, right, and facing inward to the board;
						thus, the stone has three liberties. A third case to consider is when a stone is placed on the corner intersection of the board.
						A stone placed in a corner has two liberties being that there are two horizontal and vertical intersections with respect to the stone's
						location in the corner. Examples of the three mentioned cases are provided in the images below. As mentioned, to capture an opponent's
						stone, you must enclose of all of the liberties.
						<br> </br>

						<figcaption> Fig 1: Left ~ Four Liberties, Center ~ Three Liberties, Right ~ Two Liberties </figcaption>
					</figure>
					<br> </br>
					&emsp; To explain this conept of capturing an oponents stone, I will refer to the photos directly below as refrence.
					<figure>
						<img src="images/go_blog_images/ko_example.jpg" class="image fit" />
						<figcaption> Fig 2: Left ~ Atari, Center ~ Capture, Right ~ Ko </figcaption>
					</figure>
					In the photo on the left, the white stone has one liberty left. The reason that the white stone has only one liberty left is because
					the stone only has one vertical or horizontal intersection adjacent to it not covered by an opponent's black stone. This situation
					where a stone has only one liberty left is called 'atari.' Suppose it is currently the black player's turn, and they place a stone
					on the last open liberty with respect to the white stone. This completes a capture and the white stone is removed from the board (refer to
					the center image). Now it is the white player's turn. It is necessary to know that the white player can not play immediately after in the same position to attempt to
					reclaim the territory; this is referred to as 'ko.' However, in this particular case, the white player may not place a stone even after a cycle of turns
					in the same spot since the move would cause suicide, and the stone would be recaptured. Suicidal moves are banned in Go. To prevent captures of one's stones,
					it is stragic to form groups out of them.
					<br> </br>
					&emsp; A group is formed when a player connects two or more of their own stones adjacnetly in a verticle or horizontal fashion.
					For example, three stones placed verticly adjacnt to one another forms a group (refer to image below on the left). By forming
					a group, the stones act as a single strucure and their liberties are in a manner "combined." In refence to the previouslty metnioned
					example of three stones (as shown in the image below on the left), the group has a total of eight liberties. However, recall for stones
					to be connected in order to form a group, the stones must be touching with respect to a verticle or horizontal relationship. The image provided
					below to the right is an example of two stones that do not form a group since they are only touching in a diagonal relationship.

					</figure>
					<br> </br>
					&emsp; Now that we have covered the general interactions that can occur during the game, it is time to address how the game is scored.
					As mentioned, suppose two consecutive passes occur, and the game has come to an end. The scoring formula is as such: a player's score is
					equal to the number of controlled territories minus the number of their stones taken as captive [1]. To understand the given formula, it is
					necessary to understand what is a captured territory. Placing a stone on the board is not in itself a captured territory. A captured territory
					is a space in which a single color's stone blocks all of its surrounding area. Examples of captures are provided in the images below.
					<br> </br>
					<figure>
						<img src="images/go_blog_images/count_colored.jpg" class="image fit" />
						<figcaption> Fig 4: White points ~ blue X's and Black points ~ red X's </figcaption>
					</figure>
					<br> </br>
					&emsp; In "Fig 4," a sample game on a smaller than the traditional sized board is shown. The blue X's are the captured territories of white totaling
					to six while the red X's are the black points totaling to seventeen (recall to subtract taken prisoners to your score). Thus, the black player
					would have won this game. Depending on the skill of your opponent, white may get a handicap to their score called 'komi' (usually six and a half to seven points)
					due to going second. So, from reading this post, do you know all of the rules of Go now? Unfournatly, no. Go has many nuances due to the numerous situations that may arise during the game. For myself, I watched many videos and read many
					blogs to gather a fundamental understanding of the rules of Go.
					However, I believe the fastest way to learn Go is by playing it, particularly playing Go a lot. To do so, I decided to play Go online.
