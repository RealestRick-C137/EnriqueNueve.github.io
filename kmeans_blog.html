						<h2>K-Means with MultiProcessing</h2>
						<p> Fall 2018 </p>
					</header>


					<h2> To view the notebook of this project and to see the code, <a href="https://github.com/RealestRick-C137/Parallel-K-Means/blob/master/ParallelKMeans.ipynb"> <u>click here</u> </a>. </h2>

					<br></br>
					<h5> Intro </h5>
					<p> &emsp;  Before this project, I had no experience with Multiprocessing. However, I had heard
						of how MultiProcessing could greatly increase the speed of a program by distributing process
						over multiple processing cores. With not knowing how Multiprocessing necessarily worked, I
						decided to try using the "multiprocessing" library in Python to implement the rather simple
						clustering algorithm K-Means.
					</p>

					<h5>Part 1: When to use Multiprocesing</h5>
					<p> &emsp; Multiprocessing can be used whenever a task or subtask can be performed independently
						 and then later have their individual results be clustered together. For example, renaming
						 individual files in a directory. Another example would be BootStrapping Algotirhims, where the
						 order of sampling is not relevant. Overall, a significant speed boost can occur if Multiprocessing
						 is appropriately implemented and for the right situation.
					<p>

					<h5>Part 2: Multiprocesing in Python</h5>
					<p> &emsp; Python comes installed with a base package called "multiprocessing," which allows
						one to implement code that uses multiple processing cores. To start using the multiprocessing
						library, declare an object from the library called "Process." You pass this object a function
						 and also arguments that correspond to the function. Then to finish the process, you ".join."
						 Honestly, the package is massive and can't be summarized into a single article. However, there
						 is a simple function within the library to speed up processes. That particular function is ".map."
					<p>

<pre><code>
	import time
	import multiprocessing as mp

	def add_fast(n):
	    count = 0
	    for i in range(n):
	        count += .001
	    return count

	def main():
	    n_iter = 10
	    pool = mp.Pool(mp.cpu_count())

	    t0 = time.time()
	    results = pool.map(add_fast,n_iter*[100000000])
	    print("Summed to: ", sum(results))
	    t1 = time.time()
	    print("Time to run with multiprocesing: ", t1-t0)

	    t0 = time.time()
	    results = [add_fast(100000000) for i in range(n_iter)]
	    print("Summed to: ", sum(results))
	    t1 = time.time()
	    print("Time to run without multiprocesing: ",t1-t0)

(Output) >>>
Summed to:  1000000.0002608391
Time to run with multiprocesing:  13.932849884033203
Summed to:  1000000.0002608391
Time to run without multiprocesing:  43.91646981239319

</code></pre>

<p>
As shown through the demo, multiprocessing can significantly increase the speed of a program!

					<h5>Part 3: K Means </h5>
					<p> &emsp; K Means is a simplistic unsupervised clustering algorithm. If you are interested
						in the inner working of K Means, I suggest reading the following article,
						<a href="https://stanford.edu/~cpiech/cs221/handouts/kmeans.html"> (CLICK HERE)</a>.
						Overall, I am not a fan of K Means. The results of K Means vary significantly by choice of
						initial parameters and the initial randomized points. However, the structure of the algorithm
						is ideal for parral processing; thus, I went ahead and used it for my project. Unfortunally,
						my personal implementation of K Means over parallel was actually slower than K Means
						not over parallel. Why is that?
					<p>

					<p> &emsp; Multiprocessing "can" be faster; however, depending on how it is used for a specific task,
						it can be slower. The way I implemented the algorithm is very inefficient. First, I evaluate each
						 point individually; this is much slower than if I implemented the algorithm to perform matrix operations. However, that does not explain why the multiprocessing implementation is slower. To perform multiprocesing, the data for K Means needs to be split. This is a very time-consuming operation which adds up to slower performance.
					<p>

					<h5> Conclusion </h5>
					<p> Multiprocessing allows for an immense speed boost to code. It is very intriguing to think about
						 ways multiprocessing can be used. However, in this case, due to improper design, I was unable to
						 get a boost in speed with K Means. Being this was my first time using multiprocessing, it is
						 understandable to have some difficulties. Even so, I highly recommend learning about multiprocessing
						 and trying to implement methods with it.
