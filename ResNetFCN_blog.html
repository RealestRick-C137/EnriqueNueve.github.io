          <h3>1. Intro</h3>
          <p> &emsp; Deep Learning has many uses within Computer Vision, such as classification, filling,
            optical flow, object detection, and image segmentation. In this post, I will be presenting
            an overview of the task of image segmentation and how I went about creating a Deep Learning
            model, specifically a Fully Convolutional Network with transfer learning over a ResNet, with
            TensorFlow 2 to perform image segmentation.
          </p>
          <p></p>

          <h3>2. Image Segmentation</h3>
          <p> &emsp; A common first exercise for Deep Learning is to make a model perform image classification.
            This includes building a model that can
            take in an image and then output a one-hot vector, which
            represents the model's belief of what type of object is within the image.
            Although in practice this could be very useful, in some instances, it would
            also, be informative to know where in the image the believed object is located.
            For example, say you created a model to classify whether a boat is stranded in the ocean
            based on satellite imagery. If the model alerted the Coast Guard that there was a
            stranded boat but didn't show where the boat was located would, it would make it
            infeasible to act upon such knowledge. Image segmentation addresses such a dilemma.
          </p>
          <p> &emsp; Image segmentation is the task of classifying each pixel in an image. Instead
            of just saying whether a class is present in an image, it will try to predict which pixels
            within the image belong to said class. Image segmentation is inherently more informative
            to a practitioner than plain image classification, yet the task is more challenging in
            several ways.
          </p>
          <p> &emsp; Since image segmentation is trying to predict the class of each pixel, the
            training data requires that each pixel be classified within an image. This causes the task of creating a
            training set to be a grueling process. To counter such challenges of making a dataset,
            different tools and paid services exist that will either assist or perform data labeling.
            Beyond the challenges of creating a dataset, it is also challenging to train a model given
            that the size of the data is rather large. Each target value consists of a 2D matrix where
            the entries correspond to a number that corresponds to the class the pixel belongs to. The
            size of the data makes it necessary in most cases to use data loaders and optimized
            file types for reading and writing, such as tf.Records from TensorFlow 2. Finally, it can be rather
            challenging for Deep Learning models to converge. Given that
            each pixel contributes an error value; the model can easily have the gradient
            explosion or collapse occur.
